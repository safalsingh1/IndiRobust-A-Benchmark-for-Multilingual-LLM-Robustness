# Project Specific
# We keep the analysis scripts but might want to ignore large raw results if they were huge.
# For now, we'll keep results/figures but maybe ignore raw experiment logs if they are huge.
# Given the user just ran small experiments, it's fine to commit them or ignore them.
# Usually results should be ignored.
results/experiment_*/
# Keep figures for README if they exist (though we deleted visualize_results, so maybe no figures?)
# We will ignore the experiment folders.
